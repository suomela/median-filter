Median Filter
=============

(a.k.a. **sliding window median**, **running median filter**,
and **rolling median filter**)

If you are looking for a practical median filter algorithm
for 1D and 2D data, see: https://github.com/suomela/mf2d


Problem
-------

Input:

  - vector x with n elements
  - window size k

Output:

  - vector y with n-k+1 elements
  - y[i] is the median of x[i], x[i+1], ..., x[i+kâˆ’1].

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter


Algorithms
----------

  - "sort": O(n log k): sort blocks, do linear-time post-processing

  - "heap": O(n log k): maintain a maxheap + minheap pair

  - "tree": O(n log k): maintain balanced search trees

  - "move": O(n k): maintain a sorted vector


### Sort algorithm

This algorithm is described here:

  - http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1717


### Heap algorithm

The basic idea is to maintain a maxheap + minheap pair, see:

  - http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/29.17539
  - http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/78.80784
  - http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2986349

The present implementation is by AShelly:

  - https://gist.github.com/ashelly/5665911

It was further adapted by Colin Raffel, and this is the version that
we use (almost verbatim):

Compilation
-----------

The software is written in C++11. To compile it, you will need a
recent C++ compiler. For example, the following compilers should
work fine:

  - g++ (GCC 4.7.3 or later). Tested with these versions:

        g++-4.7 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-2ubuntu1~12.04) 4.7.3
        g++-4.8 (GCC) 4.8.2
        g++-4.9 (GCC) 4.9.0

  - clang++ (LLVM 3.4 or later). Tested with these versions:

        Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.40) (based on LLVM 3.4svn)

For OS X 10.9.2, you can get the right versions of the compilers
from the following sources:

  - clang++: from Apple
  - g++-4.9: from Homebrew ("brew install gcc49")

Depending on your C++ compiler and operating system, use one of
the following scripts to compile this software.

**OS X**:

  - "bin/build-clang": compiles with "clang++"
  - "bin/build-gcc-4.8-osx": compiles with "g++-4.8"
  - "bin/build-gcc-4.9-osx": compiles with "g++-4.9"

**Linux**:

  - "bin/build-gcc": compiles with "g++"
  - "bin/build-gcc-4.7": compiles with "g++-4.7"
  - "bin/build-gcc-4.8": compiles with "g++-4.8"
  - "bin/build-gcc-4.9": compiles with "g++-4.9"

You can also try to use "scons" to compile everything. The build
scripts are configured for OS X platforms that have both clang++
and g++-4.9 installed. You can get both scons and g++-4.9 from
Homebrew.


Versions
--------

  - build-clang-short: compiled with Clang, 32-bit data
  - build-clang-long: compiled with Clang, 64-bit data
  - build-gcc-short: compiled with GCC, 32-bit data
  - build-gcc-long: compiled with GCC, 64-bit data


Tools
-----

**verify**: does some sanity-checking and makes sure that all three
algorithms produce the same output. Use the command line parameter
for larger tests, and another parameter to skip the slowest
algorithm. Examples:

    build-gcc-short/verify
    build-gcc-short/verify 10
    build-gcc-short/verify 100 x

**tester**: benchmarking with different parameter values and
different input data generators. Run without command line parameters
for brief usage instructions.


Examples
--------

See "bin/examples"

Columns:

  - algorithm
  - h, the half-window size
  - b, the number of blocks
  - input data generator
  - random seed
  - time in seconds

Here window size is k = 2h + 1.
Input data is a vector with n = bk elements.

In this example we used the following generators:

  - "r-asc": monotonically incresing sequence + random noise
  - "r-large": large random numbers

-----

  - x axis: half-window size

  - blue: "sort" algorithm
  - green: "heap" algorithm
  - red: "tree" algorithm
  - black: "move" algorithm
  - solid curve = median
  - shaded area = 10% ... 90% region
